This is a Python CLI variant of my own personal budget sheet, designed in such a way where two people's finances are tracked and calculated in a way for both parties to have a "balanced" plan so that everyone can get the bills paid while also having money for themselves.

In it's current state, I still prefer to use my spreadsheet to do all this until I can come up with a GUI that is easier to use than a spreadsheet.

This is a tool designed to help organize money flow.

CURRENT ISSUES/PLANS (using this as a board for what to work on next)

- BUG: When a person doesn't have any expenses of their own, they do not seem to appear in Expense Plan print-out
- FEATURE: Need to be able to remove expense plans from Expense Plans list
- FEATURE: Ability to edit a cashflow object (Currently, you have to delete cashflows and add them back in)
- FEATURE: Printable Expense Plans
