This is a Python CLI variant of my own personal budget sheet, designed in such a way where two people's finances are tracked and calculated in a way for both parties to have a "balanced" plan so that everyone can get the bills paid while also having money for themselves.

In it's current state, I still prefer to use my spreadsheet to do all this until I can come up with a GUI that is easier to use than a spreadsheet.

This is a tool designed to help organize money flow.
